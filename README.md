# HW11_Note-Taker

## **Description**

The main concept of this homework assignment was to use express.js to create the backend of a note-taking app and connect it to a pre-made frontend. The note data is stored as a JSON file. I was able to utilize the GET, POST, and DELETE methods of express to get the app fully functional.

## **Link**

The app is deployed on heroku [here](https://desolate-inlet-65279.herokuapp.com/).
